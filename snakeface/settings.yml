# This is a base settings.yml file that will be added to the user home
# on first use of snakeface.

# How to fill in fields? -------------------------------------------------------
# For fields that you want to leave undefined, leave them as null
# All fields get read in to a global settings.cfg.SETTING_NAME object.

# How to set secrets? ----------------------------------------------------------
# For each setting below, a value found in the environment prefixed with
# SNAKEFACE_ will override it. This means that you should generally leave 
# secrets unset (e.g., SENDGRID keys). and insteaed explort them in the 
# environment (e.g., SNAKEFACE_SENDGRID_API_KEY).
